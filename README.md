# BankLoanAnalysis_BI
Problem statement : Banks and financial institutions need to minimize the risk of losing money when issuing loans. This project demonstrates how risk analytics and data-driven insights help decide whether a loan applicant is likely to repay a loan. 

Solution :
-> Performed data analysis in MySQL to explore, clean, and join multiple relational tables.
-> Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in Python (Google Colab) for deeper statistical insights and to clean and understand the data before feeding it into Power BI.
-> Built interactive dashboards in Power BI to help decision-makers quickly evaluate applicant profiles and make informed lending decisions—approve when risk is low, decline when risk is high.

Tech Stack :
Power BI – Interactive dashboards and visual analytics
Python (Google Colab) – Data cleaning and EDA (pandas, matplotlib)
SQL – Relational data modeling and joins across tables

WorkFlow - Excel (to csv file) -> MySQL -> Google Colab(Python) : EDA -> PowerBI
